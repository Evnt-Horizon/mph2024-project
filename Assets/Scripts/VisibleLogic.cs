 * This class will contain the logic of all visible components (HUD) between the camera, ship and blackhole
 * interactions. This class contains the following methods: Calculation of the relative speed of light while traversing
 * through the layers (accretion disk & black hole), how time behaves in the face of time dilation as they approach
 * the entity (special relativity), and Doppler Shift of the observer in respects to the beam of light.
